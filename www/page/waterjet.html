	<h4>The latest addition to <span>Toronto Granite&rsquo;s</span> array of advanced machinery is a Flow International Corp. Waterjet cutting system, with Dynamic Waterjet® technology.</h4>
	<br>
	<h4>Waterjet is the fastest growing machine tool process in the world. It cuts without heat and leaves a clean edge, eliminating the need for secondary finishing. It works by pressurizing water up to 60,000 psi, and forcing it through a tiny opening. Waterjets are capable of cutting a variety of materials with CNC accuracy. Typical part tolerances range from between 0.003 and 0.005 of an inch.</h4>
	<br>
	<h4>Waterjet cutting systems are the world's most versatile machine tools. They are capable of cutting virtually any shape in a single step with edge quality that usually requires no secondary finishing. They're the most productive solution for cutting a wide range of materials from 1/16 inch to more than eight inches thick.</h4>
